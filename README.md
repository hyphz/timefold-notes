# timefold-notes
Potentially useful documentation notes on Timefold.ai Community Edition.

Please see the wiki for content.

This is a repository for all the "oh, I wish I realised that" moments I had while implementing Timefold.ai. The documentation for Timefold gives a very clear overview of how many things work but doesn't always cover all the options you have, and left me somewhat lost several times. Beyond that, the next step is to turn to the Timefold source code Javadoc, which is quite dense and technical, so I thought it might be nice to have a middle ground!

The main language used is Kotlin since that's what I used, but the results should be applicable to Java also.
